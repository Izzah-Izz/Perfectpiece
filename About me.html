<p>Name : </p><h5>Nur Azzarina Binti Sabri</h5>
				<content>I am a student who will become a teacher. I have a unique personality. I'm a shy person but I'll be the one who talks a lot when I'm around people I'm comfortable with.
					I am of Javanese descent because my mother was born in Indonesia. I'm 20 years old. I am from Sarawak<br>
					<br>In the journey of life, friends come and go, but there’s always that one friend who stands out. The one who understands you without words,<br>
					who celebrates your successes and comforts you in your lows. This friend becomes a part of your soul, making your life richer and more vibrant.
					Whether it's sharing secrets, creating unforgettable memories, or just being there in silence, this bond is unbreakable. They see your true self and accept you just the way you are,
					flaws and all. Such a friend is a rare gem, someone to cherish and hold dear forever.<br>
					<br>Here’s to the laughter, the adventures, the inside jokes, and the unwavering support. Here's to that one and only friend who makes life a little bit sweeter.</content>
